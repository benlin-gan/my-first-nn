#My First Neural Net
I did a project like this before in August of 2021, but I lost all the code when my old laptop got bricked.

##no_hidden_layers.mdl

- Has no hidden layers
- 784 inputs and 10 outputs
- 1/(1+e^-x) activation
- weights & biases initialized between -0.1 and 0.1
- learning rate 0.1
- batch size 100
- used all training examples I think
- reasonably accurate (~70%%???), but isn't very confident
