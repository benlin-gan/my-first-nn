# My First Neural Net
I did a project like this before in August of 2021, but I lost all the code when my old laptop got bricked.

## no_hidden_layers.mdl

- Has no hidden layers
- 784 inputs and 10 outputs
- 1/(1+e^-x) activation
- weights & biases initialized between -0.1 and 0.1
- learning rate 0.1
- batch size 100
- used all training examples I think
- reasonably accurate (~70%???), but isn't very confident
- This number is extremely sketchy, because the validation data is the same as the testing data lol, and I didn't do a formal test for accuracy
- But I'm so done working on this project (for now), I was never sure whether my code had a bug, or my hyperparameters were bad.
- I do remember being able to get higher accuracy before, and I remember training took a lot longer (had a few hidden layers, don't remember exactly)
